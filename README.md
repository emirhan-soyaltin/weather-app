### About this project

This is my first react project with using APIs. I used my knowledge about react, state, API and jsx to assemble components to make this project. In this practice i learned how to use API effective. But my free api doesn't include all the weathers. It includes random 3 hour forecast for next days so i tried to make it suitable for it.I added features for the next days and included all the data I'm receiving and make it useable for the user. Hope you enjoy it.
